## christmas-card READ.ME
Very simple Christmas cards created by using the Turtle module. I created this simple card by following the instructions given by GeekTutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Riz_zygXA) on YT and wanted to use it as a basis for creating a more interactive Christmas card for friends which I did. The 2nd try is in the file called "christmas card.py"
